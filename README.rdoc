= darkness

darkness is a Darkroom-like (http://they.misled.us/dark-room) clone, that runs on JRuby with Java Swing.
The purpose of darkness was educational; to provide a showcase of converting an old demo app from Java to JRuby. However, it is fully usable and can become a cross platform, lightweight, alternative to those who want to write distraction free.


== Usage

do this in your favorite commandline:
    $jruby darkness.rb

== Keys

ESC quits.
Use CTRL(Command)-L, CTRL(Command)-S to load and save.

== About

Converting your existing Swing application from Java to JRuby is very possible. I've started doing this with zero knowledge of referencing Java from my JRuby powered code. I've learnt everything on the fly.
Take a look at the sources of both the original and the JRuby version. You may like the reduction in code size and readability and tempted to do the same for your apps. I've also included in comments some pitfalls I've fallen into.

== Todo

I have several plans to jump this editor from just a shell editor to something very much more serious, stay tuned or contact me if you like the direction this is taking and you want to contribute directly.
